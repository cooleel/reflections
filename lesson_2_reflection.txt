Q1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
After I did "git init", I got a .git file in my current working directory.

Q2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's more like an imtermdiate, it offers a cache stage to bridge the working directory and repository, and could make the commit a good size.
