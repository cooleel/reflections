When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


Q1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Github will save your commit all the time, in this case you can manually keep the size of the commit without a lot of useless commit.

Q2. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is the online version of clone, in my opinion.
and branches can have a copy from your master at this point. 
on github use fork. from github to local or local to local is clone. and in one project, create different branches if you wanna try difference versions or work on difference small part of your work.

Q3.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It will tolerate the two different commit version, and to deal with the conflict better.

Q4.How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I can't image this, probably the only way is to save every changes for the collaboration file. and of couse the git stuff makes things much easier.

Q5. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
If you want to make a change totally not related to the main part of your project or want to try some new features or different design style, you might want to make these stuff on a separate branch. in this way, you won't mess up with your master brancn and if the changes work, you can merge the separate branch back to master anytime.
