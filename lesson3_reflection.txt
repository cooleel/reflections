When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


Q1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Github will save your commit all the time, in this case you can manually keep the size of the commit without a lot of useless commit.
